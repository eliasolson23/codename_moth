# Luminaria (Codename Moth)

Luminaria is a platforming adventure game that follows the story of Aspen, a young moth who has found themselves trapped in an unfamiliar world in the aftermath of a great tragedy. Armed with only their trusty lantern lighter, Aspen must bring light to a dark world as they embark on a journey to find their way home.

Players will take control of Aspen as they navigate a 2D side-scrolling, fantasy forest environment, overcoming obstacles and meeting the other inhabitants of this world along the way.

Currently in development under the codename "Moth".
